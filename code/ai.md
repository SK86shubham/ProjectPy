### üìù **Project Explanation: Predicting Sleep Quality**

#### 1. **Introduction**

The goal of this project was to predict the **quality of sleep** based on smartphone usage data. We used features like:

* **Screen time** (How much time you spend on your phone)
* **Blue light exposure** (How long you're exposed to phone screens without blue light filters)
* **Sleep duration** (How many hours you sleep)
* **Bedtime** (What time you sleep)

The sleep quality was rated on a scale from **1 (poor)** to **5 (excellent)**.

---

#### 2. **Approach**

We first tried using a **Random Forest model**, which gave us an accuracy of only **49.9%**. The results were not as good as expected, possibly due to the data's randomness and the complexity of the model.

So, to improve this, we switched to a simpler model: **Logistic Regression**. This gave us a better result of **62.5% accuracy**.

---

#### 3. **Why Logistic Regression?**

**Logistic Regression** is easier to interpret and works well when the relationship between the features and target is simple. Since we only had a few features (screen time, blue light exposure, sleep duration, and bedtime), Logistic Regression gave us more accurate results.

#### 4. **Steps Taken in the Project:**

1. **Data Preparation:**

   * Collected data that includes information on screen time, blue light exposure, sleep duration, etc.
   * Split the data into **training** and **testing** sets (80% for training, 20% for testing).

2. **Feature Scaling:**

   * Used **StandardScaler** to scale the data, so that all features have the same weight and are easier to process.

3. **Model Building:**

   * **Random Forest Classifier** was tried first, but the accuracy was only **49.9%**.
   * Switched to **Logistic Regression** which performed better with an accuracy of **62.5%**.

4. **Prediction:**

   * Given some user input (like screen time, blue light exposure, etc.), the model predicts a sleep quality value between **1 to 5**.

---

#### 5. **Results:**

* **Random Forest Accuracy**: 49.9%
* **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: 62.5%
* The Logistic Regression model predicted **sleep quality of 2** (out of 5) for typical input values.

---

#### 6. **Conclusion:**

* Logistic Regression worked better for this dataset.
* The **accuracy** may improve with more data and by adding more features like caffeine intake, physical activity, etc.
